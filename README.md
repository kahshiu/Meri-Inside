# Core-framework
An experimental application written in Coldfusion (CF), Lucee server.

CF Framework:
This project sticks close to CF's original framework, while taking inspiration from good old Fusebox and FW/1, favouring naming convention over configuration.

Front end:
HTML: Favours the use of full form submission instead of Ajax
CSS: Draws from Bijou CSS minimalist framework
JS: JQuery, Underscore.js
