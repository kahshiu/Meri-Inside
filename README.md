# Core-framework
An experimental application written in Coldfusion (CF), Lucee server.  
  
CF Framework:  
This project sticks close to CF's original framework, while taking inspiration from good old Fusebox and FW/1, favouring naming convention over configuration.
  
Front end:  
HTML: Favours the use of full form submission instead of Ajax  
CSS: Draws from Bijou CSS minimalist framework  
JS: JQuery, Underscore.js
  
Update:  
Project currently merged in Merimen training pages until core application services (CF, CSS, JS) stabilises to branch into another repo.
